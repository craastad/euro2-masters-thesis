# Euro 2.0 Master's Thesis

TL;DR: this 112 page thesis describes the Euro 2.0 system and performs an old-school security analysis to draw some obvious conclusions. I can't say it's the most academically or scientifically compelling work on the planet. Overall I'm proud of using the thesis as a way to dive deep into the [Euro 2.0 Project](https://github.com/cryptofiat) and understand the nuances of an Ethereum based architecture from a security and usablity standpoint.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Introduction}

\subsection{Setting the Stage}
Payments today are the laggard of the information age. While emails can be sent instantly money is either slow and/or expensive to move digitally. Bank transfers can take days, only work during business hours, and have high fees across borders. Card payments are instant but enslave merchants with high fees and chargeback risks. Paypal brought payments to the internet, but still brings a cost to accept payments and moving funds across borders. Fintech companies like Venmo and Square can make the illusion of fast payments, but still take days to settle in the background with the same chargeback risks. All of this inconvenience comes from the centralised Financial system of banking that has little economic motivation to innovate and undo legacy. A usable digital currency would greatly alleviate this friction in transferring value that costs the economy an estimated 1\% of GDP annually \cite{kaarmann2013cost}.

Bitcoin was the first mover in digital currency introducing a clever mechanism of digital value transfer completely sidestepping the existing financial system\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. Its distributed proof of work consensus protocol, clever economical incentives to maintain the network, irreversible transactions, and pseudo anonymous users sent waves of interest and skepticism in the financial and regulatory community. At the beginning of 2014, 5 years after the genesis block, the world's first cryptocurrency already had billions of dollars market capitalisation\cite{coinmarketcap2017bitcoin}, more than 100,000 daily active users doubling roughly every 8 months\cite{RePEc:fip:fedgfe:2014-104}, and hundreds of companies founded to drive the ecosystem\todo{citation needed for number of companies}. Altcoins forked the Bitcoin blockchain technology to tackle other use cases and attempt to overcome shortcomings of Bitcoin. Exchanges sprung up to bring institutional trust into the ecosystem, making it easier to buy and sell bitcoins and bridging the gap between the traditional world of finance and digital currency. Eventually Bitcoin could be used to buy Domino's pizza and airline tickets\todo{citation needed for dominos pizza and airline tickets}.

Yet payments are a niche use case in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\cite{sas2016design}. The main use case thus far being long term value savings and short term ``get-rich-quick'' investment speculation. Bitcoin is complicated to use, takes minutes to confidently clear transactions, lacks clear governance structure, has long term scaling worries, and missing key features of trust and user identity making it unfavourable for mainstream commerce. In addition, converting the digital currency to and from the banking financial world comes at a cost. Providers of goods and services can ``accept'' Bitcoin but in reality immediately convert the funds to a fiat currency at a 1\% fee\todo{citation for 1\% transaction fee}. The real world is not yet priced in BTC. Bitcoin does not solve the problems of the majority of society running on the traditional financial system.

An improvement is to bring fiat currency and the traditional financial system into the realm of digital currency. This manuscript explores Euro 2.0 digital currency system. Trust, regulation, and convenience are built in with Estonian ID and the Ethereum blockchain smart contract technology. The system removes the need of financial institution intermediaries to profit off of holding balances and executing payments. The usability and trust for payments arises from ease of sending to personal Estonian ID codes, identification of users on the system, and use of a common fiat currency, Euro. We explore how to derive the need of this system for stakeholders, the technical requirements, and analyse the security and privacy of its implementation. The system can be initially managed by a foundation and completely run later by central banks saving the economy a majority of its 1\% GDP lost annually to payment friction \cite{kaarmann2013cost}.

\subsection{History of Currency and Payments}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed for history of money and cards\ldots}
Money and payments haven been part of human society since the dawn of civilisation. Currency grew out of the need to transport value of goods without transferring the goods themselves. First came gold, silver, and other precious metals to trade in exchange for goods and services. Later in the 1600s came notes issued by the Bank of England backed by silver and shortly after followed every country in the Western world. Over this time Banks grew as the de facto institutions to store and transfer value in government issued currencies. By the 1950s the USA was the first government to eliminate a physical backing (silver) to create a fiat currency only backed by the trust of the US Government and Federal Reserve. Again, shortly after other countries followed suit and there are no countries left physically backing notes; money is entirely trust that society accepts the government backed notes for exchange of goods and service.

As early as the 1960s banks were some of the first adopters of information technology, using computers and databases to overhaul paper processes. The first electronic access of money was the Credit Card, its earliest usage was a credit exchange between private companies in the USA in the 1920s, Diners’ Club, Inc. for consumers in 1950, American Express Travel and Entertainment card in 1958, and finally the founding of VISA in 1976 to spread the concept globally\cite{britannica2016creditcard}. Debit cards directly debiting bank accounts hit market as early as 1966 in the USA, long before mass consumer adoption of technology, gaining popularity in the 80s and 90s with the rise of ATM network and merchant acceptance\cite{collins2011debitcard}. With all of these developments, the Financial institutions of banks and payment processors are the heart of system and source of high fees. Credit Cards cost  merchants 1-3\% transaction fees and carry the risk of costly chargebacks at the benefit of consumer convenience. Debit cards are slightly better, charging about \euro0.45 per swipe \cite{kaarmann2014government}. \todo{Cite source of fees and average fees either for a country or the whole world}

\todo[inline]{Citations needed for average cost of bank transfers globally}
With consumer adoption of the internet came personal windows into our finances via online banking. Bank transfers can take days to settle and only work during working hours of weekdays. International bank transfers can take even longer and with a heavy 3-5\% fee.  Many transactions in financial systems, such as stock trades, can happen ``instantly'' but in fact take days to settle on the backend due to legacy paper based processes. \todo{citation needed for stock trades settlement times} The financial industry and has only in this time created pretty facades to their inefficient processes. Paypal succeeding to bring payments to the internet, but is still atrociously expensive to send and receive card payments, charging 2.9\% + \$0.30 USD per transaction and adding a 2.5\% fee on top of a bank dictated currency conversion spread for international conversion of funds\cite{paypal2017fees}.

\todo[inline]{How do AML and KYC laws fit into the picture of payment costs?}

Why all the friction? The economic cost of payments is an estimated at 1\% of GDP annually \cite{kaarmann2013cost}. Financial institutions designed themselves to profit from the friction in payments\todo{cite bank incentives to keep payment costs high}. International money transfer moves between four or more levels of banks, each taking a small slice of the fee, until funds reach the destination bank\todo{cite cost and process of international money transfer}. Consumer banking creates the illusion of free domestic transfers though subsidisation, but makes the meat of their profit from transactions data to sell customers credit and loans\todo{bank local transfer subsidisation and methods of making money}. Institutional investment banks gamble with our money every day on Wall Street, when things get out of hand, we have the Financial meltdown of 2008\todo{cite financial crisis of 2008}. Even post financial crisis, too big to fail banks have barely changed there ways. With increased regulatory costs and greedy shareholders comes even less economical incentive to reduce the cost of payments\todo{cite something referring to big banks being greedy or having no motivation to reduce fees}.

\subsection{Bitcoin: The Protocol for Money}

Following the 2008 crisis, Satoshi Nakamoto quietly released \textit{Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System}\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} aiming to solve the business problem \textit{``How do I create a system where nobody can stop me spending my own money?''}\cite{brown2016introducing}. A decentralised system \textit{``based on cryptographic proof instead of trust''} allows parties to transact with each other directly without a trusted third party. Double spending is prevented by a \textit{``peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions"}\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. This computational proof is distributed in the amongst participant nodes in the network in a voting scheme governed by a cryptographic puzzle known as \textit{proof-of-work}. Nodes compete to publish a block of transactions in the system for a reward of Bitcoins and transaction fees. The proof of work mechanism probabilistically limits the network to publish a new block of transactions approximately every ten minutes. Blocks reference previous blocks and once published are irrevocable unless another node were to rewrite history by solving the cryptographic puzzle multiple times, which is computationally infeasible. Hence transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversable. This chain of blocks of transactions cryptographically tied in a historical record is the \textit{blockchain}. Nodes are incentivised to act in their best interest and maintain the network to claim their reward, currently worth 12.5 BTC per block and more than 15,000 USD at the time of this writing, a process commonly known as \textit{mining}. A published block has to be valid in history, i.e. no double spent bitcoins and a valid proof-of-work solution, to be accepted by the network. With this consensus mechanism, the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network maintains itself without a centralised entity\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}.

Users of the bitcoin network enjoy the possibility of pseudo-anonymity in using the system. Transactions are a chain of digital signatures. Public keys are the addresses which can be thought of accounts. Private keys are the proof of ownership of a public key which allow the right to claim ownership and spend all coins previously sent to that address. A user only requires a private and public key tied to some unspent tokens in order to use the system\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. All transaction hashes and public keys addresses are published in blocks on the blockchain \textit{public ledger}. Anyone can view produced blocks and transactions by downloading a Bitcoin client or browsing an online tool like Blockchain Info\cite{blockchaininfo}.  Pseudo-anonymity comes from the fact once the a Bitcoin address is linked to a real identity, all present, past, and future transactions are visible on the public ledger. Graph analysis of the the entire Bitcoin blockchain can reveal clues of transaction patterns, owners of addresses and networks of miners\todo{Cite something regarding graph analysis}.

Bitcoins counteracts inflation of traditional monetary systems with a limited supply, designed to emulate a growth curve similar to gold\todo{cite gold}. This supply is algorithmically limited to 21,000,000 BTC, which will be all mined into circulation around year 2140. In Theory, Bitcoin will become more and more valuable overtime because of its rarity\todo{Bitcoin supply vs inflation}, hence an attractive mechanism for long term savings.

Bitcoin transactions are geographically independent. Since the entire global network runs distributively on the internet and not controlled by a central party, transactions can happen anywhere a client has enough internet bandwidth to broadcast to the network. Theoretically \todo{find reference for bitcoin independent of geopolitical entities} Bitcoin is a completely governmental independent store and growth of value, but its price does fluctuate with geopolitical events in China, USA, and UK (Brexit) \todo{find reference relating Bitcoin price and geopolitical events}.

Bitcoin has a major benefit low cost transactions. Currently the transactions are free, since miners are incentivised enough by Bitcoin rewards mining new blocks of transactions. When Bitcoin supply approaches its upper bound, already 99\% of Bitcoins will be mined by 2036, then transaction fees must take over as incentive for miners to maintain the network\todo{find reference for network transaction fees}.   

\subsection{Bitcoin Trust Paradox}
Bitcoin gained an enormous amount of infamous attention with the Silk Road, the ``Ebay for Drugs''\cite{EbayForDrugs}. The website amassed over 1000 vendors, tens of millions of dollars of revenue, and triple digit yearly growth until it was shutdown by the FBI in 2013 after two and a half years operation\cite{NotAnEbayForDrugs}. The buyers were protected in escrow Bitcoin transaction, only releasing payment to the sellar if the buyer was completely satisfied. Bitcoin allowed payments amongst parties that can barely trust each other in real life. \textit{``Anonymity and lack of regulation which is meant to free users from central authorities also empowers drug dealers and money launderers''}\cite{Ali:2015:BPU:2990603.2990632}.

Sas and Khairuddin interviewed 20 Bitcoin users to explore the challenges and opportunities of Bitcoin users with respect to technological, social, and institutional trust\cite{sas2016design}. The economic rationale of holding bitcoins derived from distrust in governments and banks directly having access to bank account funds, fear of unfavourable currency movements due to inflation, economic downturn, or politcal events, and speculation that Bitcoin will become more and more valuable over time. Ironically, they found ``spending bitcoins as a currency appears as an exception rather than a norm''. Bitcoin behaves more like a commodity than a currency\todo{cite why Bitcoin is more like a commodity}. The short term fluctuations of value and difficult to grasp price with regards fiat currency makes it unattractive for end to end commerce in Bitcoin\todo{cite short term fluctuations and pricing}.

From the findings of Ali, Clarke, and McCorry \textit{``Bitcoin’s strengths and weaknesses both derive from the same essential ideological and architectural design choices''}\cite{Ali:2015:BPU:2990603.2990632}. Sas and Khairuddin support this statement with their analyse Bitcoin user experiences with regards to the Blockchain's characteristics and their impact on trust \cite{sas2016design}. The decentralised Blockchain gives users a sense of honestly and credibility contrasted to sometimes dishonest central financial institutions. Users value transparency in the public ledger as well as easy, quick, and low cost transactions. Unregulated Blockchain gives users a sense of empowerment, setting no limits to transaction frequency and size, and comfort in the impossibility of governmental intervening with of financial matters directly in the system.

On the other hand, surveyed users showed concern over insecure transactions and risks associated with literally handling their own finances which were categorised by the authors as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Risks Due to Users' Challenges of Handling Passwords} (or private keys)
	\item \textit{Risks Due to Hackers' Malicious Attacks} to steal coins
	\item \textit{Risks Due to Failure to Recover from Human Error or Malice}
	\item \textit{Risks Related to Dishonest Partner of Transaction}
\end{itemize}
These risks are heightened by hackers benefiting from irreversibility of transactions, lack of regulation, and pseudo-anonymity. The same factors increase the severity of losses to a user's own error, such as a forgotten password, wrong account address, or incorrect amount in a transaction. Off chain components of transactions, such as the exchange of fiat currency for bitcoin or receiving goods, have no security or trace on the Blockchain.

The authors propose strategies for mitigating the risks of dishonest traders, the main source of user distrust in transacting with Bitcoin: \todo{more citations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Trade with Authorized Exchanges}
	\item \textit{Trade with Socially Authorized Traders}
	\item \textit{Trade with Reputable Individual Traders}
	\item \textit{Trade with De-anonymised Individual Traders}
	\item \textit{Regulating Bitcoin}
\end{itemize}
These propositions to mitigate risks paradoxically nullify some key privacy and decentralised features of Bitcoin. Users are more likely to trust the counter-party when they are socially validated and/or identified and no longer anonymous, a type of user and community driven KYC to build trust. Exchanges add an interface to the traditional financial ecosystem, forcing users to undergo traditional AML/KYC processes. Regulating Bitcoin completely goes against the original vision of Nakamoto, but could help users deal with dishonest traders and bring the security and institutional trust of regulated financial institutions, which is currently best served by exchanges.

The authors propose three general design implications for Bitcoin further undermining the foundation of the protocal:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Supporting Transparency of Two-way Transactions}
	\item \textit{Tools for Materialising Trust in Blockchain}
	\item \textit{Tools to Support Reversible Transactions}
\end{itemize}
The key findings of the study demonstrate the need of a usable digital currency and motivate the creation of Euro 2.0 system.

\textit{``Denoting money as virtual assets to remove reliance on banks also opens the doors to hackers and malware.''}\cite{Ali:2015:BPU:2990603.2990632}.

\subsection{Altcoins}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed \ldots}
Bitcoin and altcoins have until now had more traction for long term investment and get-rich-quick speculation then becoming the next generation payment method. Websites and stores accepting Bitcoin do so more for marketing then actual economic incentive. Accepting Bitcoin with a payment provider is in fact just charging a 1\% fee to receive payment directly to a fiat currency bank account with development costs of integrating a new payment method.

\subsection{What's Missing for Digital Currency?}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed Bitcoin HCI study \ldots}
Despite this promising rise of the value transfer protocol, payments for goods and services are still a very niche use case for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What's preventing cryptocurrencies from widespread adoption for payments? Ironically the defining features of Bitcoin, pseudo anonymity, irreversibility of transactions, and lack of central regulations, make for an unattractive payments system. Exchanges arose to be a more trustworthy source to buy and sell Bitcoins and create a regulated gateway to the traditional financial system. Transacting with individuals outside of exchanges poses great risk with off chain components of transactions. Users end up doing KYC on their counter-party or rely on other community verification to gain trust in completing transactions.

The benefits of digital currency are realised only if there is end to end adoption. Current solutions lack incentives for merchants to keep their funds in a digital currency, adding to costs of converting funds back to a fiat and existing financial system. Users must take risks or pay a cost to get funds from fiat system to the crytpo system. Facelifting the existing financial system from existing fiat to digital fiat currency unlock all of the benefits and decrease the friction in the economy.

\label{Introduction}

\subsection{Setting the Stage}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed \ldots}
Payments today are the laggard of the information age. While emails can be sent instantly money is either slow and/or expensive to move digitally. Bank transfers can take days, only work during business hours, and have high fees across borders. Card payments are instant but enslave merchants with 3\% fees and risk of chargebacks. Paypal brought payments to the internet, but still brings a layer of cost and inconvenience when moving and withdrawing funds. Fintech companies like Venmo and Square can make the illusion of fast payments, but still take days to settle in the background. All of this inconvenience comes from legacy Financial system of banking that has little economic motivation to innovate. A usable digital currency would greatly alleviate this friction in transferring value that costs the economy an estimated 1\% of GDP annually.

Bitcoin was the first mover in digital currency introducing a clever mechanism of digital value transfer completely sidestepping the existing financial system.\cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin} Its distributed consensus protocol, clever economical incentives to maintain the network, irreversible transactions, and pseudo anonymous users sent waves of interest and skepticism in the financial and regulatory community. In great surprise, 8 years later the world's first cryptocurrency gained billions of dollars market capitalization, tens of thousands of daily users, and hundreds of companies founded for driving the ecosystem. Altcoins forked the Bitcoin blockchain technology to tackle other use cases and attempt to overcome shortcomings of Bitcoin. Exchanges sprung up to bring institutional trust into the ecosystem, making it easier to buy and sell bitcoins and bridging the gap between the traditional world of finance and digital currency. Eventually Bitcoin could be used to buy Domino's pizza and airline tickets.

Yet payments are a niche use case in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The main use case thus far being long term value storage investment and short term ``get-rich-quick'' speculation. Bitcoin is complicated to use, takes minutes to confidently clear transactions, lacks clear governance structure, has long term scaling worries, and missing key features of trust and user identity making it unfavorable for mainstream commerce. In addition converting the digital currency to and from the banking financial world comes at a cost. Providers of goods and services can ``accept'' Bitcoin but in reality immediately convert the funds to a fiat currency at a 1\% fee. The real world is not priced in BTC. Bitcoin is not the short term solution for society benefits of a digital currency.

The solution is to bring fiat currency and the traditional financial system into the realm of digital currency. This manuscript explores Euro 2.0 digital currency system. Trust, regulation, and convenience are built in with Estonian ID and the Ethereum blockchain smart contract technology. The system removes the need of financial institution intermediaries to profit off of holding balances and executing payments. The usability for payments arises from ease of sending to personal Estonian ID codes, identification of users on the system, and use of a common fiat currency, Euro. We explore how to derive the need of this system for stakeholders, the technical requirements, and the security and privacy of its implementation. The system can be initially managed by a foundation and completely run later by central banks saving the economy a majority of its 1\% GDP lost annually to payment friction.

\subsection{History of Currency and Payments}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed \ldots}
Money and payments haven been part of human society since the dawn of civilization. Currency grew out of the need to transport value of goods without transferring the goods themselves. First came gold, silver, and other precious metals to trade in exchange for goods and services. Later in the 1600s came notes issued by the Bank of England backed by silver and shortly after followed every country in the Western world. Over this time Banks grew as the de facto institutions store and transfer value in government currencies. By the 1950s the USA was the first government to eliminate a physical backing (silver) to create a fiat currency only backed by the trust of the US Government and Federal Reserve. Again, shortly after other countries followed suit and there are no countries left physically backing notes; money is completely a trust contract with the government and society.

As early as the 1960s banks were some of the first adopters of information technology, using computers and databases to overhaul paper processes. The electronic access of money was the Credit Card, its earliest niche private usage was the USA in the 1920s, Diners’ Club, Inc. in 1950, American Express Travel and Entertainment card in 1958, and finally the founding of VISA in 1976 to spread the usage globally. \todo{Cite EB Credit card} Debit cards directly debiting bank accounts hit market as early as 1966 in the USA, long before mass consumer adoption of technology, gaining popularity in the 80s and 90s with the rise of ATM network and merchant acceptance. \todo{Cite A short history of the debit card} With all of these developments, the Financial institutions of banks and payment processors are the heart of system and source of high fees. \todo{Add the recent average fees of Debit and Credit cards for consumers and merchants in some country or the world} Credit Cards cost  merchants 1-3\% transaction fees and carry the risk of costly chargebacks at the benefit of consumer convenience. Debit cards are slightly better, charging on average \$0.40 per swipe. \todo{Clarify fees of cards}

\todo[inline]{Citations needed for average cost of bank transfers globally}
With consumer adoption of the internet came personal windows into our finances via online banking. Bank transfers can take days to settle and only work during working hours of weekdays. International bank transfers can take even longer and with a heavy 3-5\% fee.  Many transactions in financial systems, such as stock trades, can happen ``instantly'' but in fact take days to settle on the backend due to legacy paper based processes. \todo{citation needed for stock trades settlement times} The financial industry and has only in this time created pretty facades to their inefficient processes. Paypal succeeding to bring payments to the internet, but is still atrociously expensive to send and receive card payments, 2.9\% + \$0.30 USD plus a 2.5\% spread for international movement of funds. \todo{Cite https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/What-are-the-fees-for-PayPal-accounts-FAQ690}

Why all the friction? The economic cost of payments is an estimated at 1\% of GDP annually \todo{citation needed}. Financial institutions designed themselves to profit from creating friction in payments. International money transfer moves between four or more levels of banks, each taking a small slice of the fee, until funds reach the destination bank. Consumer banking creates the illusion of free transfers though subsidization, but makes the meat of their profits from transactions data to sell customers credit and loans. Institutional banks gamble with our money every day on Wall Street, when things get out of hand, we have the Financial meltdown of 2008. Even post crisis, too big to fail banks have barely changed there ways. With increased regulation and costs comes even less need to change the cost of payments.

\subsection{Bitcoin Revolution}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed \ldots}
In a endless downward spiral of legacy and greed, following 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto unleased Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. The clever decentralized, proof of work, consensus system of value transfer solving the business problem ``how do I create a system where nobody can stop me spending my own money?'' \todo{cite R3 cordata}. A by product of the the Bitcoin system is the Blockchain distributed ledger technology. This consensus mechanism inspired developers to create hundreds of different altcoins to overcome some shortcomings of the Bitcoin and tackle a variety of uses cases with similar technology.

\subsection{Altcoins and Exchanges}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed \ldots}
Bitcoin and altcoins have until now had more traction for long term investment and get-rich-quick speculation then becoming the next generation payment method. Websites and stores accepting Bitcoin do so more for marketing then actual economic incentive. Accepting Bitcoin with a payment provider is in fact just charging a 1\% fee to receive payment directly to a fiat currency bank account with development costs of integrating a new payment method.

\subsection{What's Missing for Digital Currency?}
\todo[inline]{Citations needed Bitcoin HCI study \ldots}
Despite this promising rise of the value transfer protocol, payments for goods and services are still a very niche use case for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. What's preventing cryptocurrencies from widespread adoption for payments? Ironically the defining features of Bitcoin, pseudo anonymity, irreversibility of transactions, and lack of central regulations, make for an unattractive payments system. Exchanges arose to be a more trustworthy source to buy and sell Bitcoins and create a regulated gateway to the traditional financial system. Transacting with individuals outside of exchanges poses great risk with off chain components of transactions. Users end up doing KYC on their counter-party or rely on other community verification to gain trust in completing transactions.
